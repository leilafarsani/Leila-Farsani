### I am going to make a personal portfolio using TS, Next, Tailwind 

## Steps
1. Installed the latest version of Next.js witch is 13(?).
### I chose these when installing.
- Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? Yes
- Would you like to use ESLint with this project? No 
- Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? Yes
- Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? No
- Use App Router (recommended)? Yes
- Would you like to customize the default import alias? No 
- Pressed enter

2. Installed some other additional packages such as react icons, framer motions and Material UI 
```
npm i react-icons framer-motion @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```
3. run the server with 
```
npm run dev
```
4. Edited page.tsx inside the app folder 

5. Inside the app folder created a folder named scenes, and inside that I created a file named Hero.tsx for my first page and started with creating the functional component Hero with rafce.

6. In the main root I created my components folder, so I can locate all the components I am creating later on inside it.

7. As I decided to have Hero page as my homepage, so I imported it into page.tsx.

8. As I'm going to have more than one button in the same form, then I created a component for it.
